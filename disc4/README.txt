/**
 * Second grade math test generator
 * 
 * We want to test second grade students' math. We will give them 10 randomly generated 
 * addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division questions. 
 *  For example:
 *  
Questions:
86+28= 
3+46= 
93*80= 
5+56= 
40-25= 
59/51= 
16/14= 
69+75= 
60+63= 
59-44= 

*We also want to generate the solution to check their answer. 
*For example:

Solution:
86+28=114
3+46=49
93*80=7440
5+56=61
40-25=15
59/51=1
16/14=1
69+75=144
60+63=123
59-44=15

For this project, you implement the classes that generate addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division questions. 

When you run the MathTest, you will see:

Questions:
86+28= 
3+46= 
93*80= 
5+56= 
40-25= 
59/51= 
16/14= 
69+75= 
60+63= 
59-44=  
Solution:
86+28=114
3+46=49
93*80=7440
5+56=61
40-25=15
59/51=1
16/14=1
69+75=144
60+63=123
59-44=15
 *  
 *  
 *  Second graders do not know negative numbers and fractions. Therefore, 
 *  for subtraction and division, you make sure first operand is always grater 
 *  than the second operand. Additionally, apply integer division when dividing.
